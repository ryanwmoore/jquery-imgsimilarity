<h2>About</h2>

<p>This jQuery library enables image similarity calculations. It uses a histogram
based approach to calculate how similar images are. It is rather simple and
examines only R, G, B values but, nevertheless, be careful when using it on
many images or large images (especially on mobile devices) -- as it may be
slow. The calculation is done once and requires little memory.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>See the demo.html file. Be sure that the image has completely loaded before you
try to compute its histogram! See the demo.html for an example of how to do
this.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>jQuery: <a href="http://jquery.com/">http://jquery.com/</a> -- tested with v1.8.2.</p>

<p>A browser that supports canvas. Tested in Firefox 16 and Internet Explorer 9.
It doesn't do anything very fancy with canvas and so should work in other
browsers.</p>
