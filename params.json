It uses a histogram\r\nbased approach to calculate how similar images are. It is rather simple and\r\nexamines only R, G, B values but, nevertheless, be careful when using it on\r\nmany images or large images (especially on mobile devices) -- as it may be\r\nslow. The calculation is done once and requires little memory.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nSee the demo.html file. Be sure that the image has completely loaded before you\r\ntry to compute its histogram! See the demo.html for an example of how to do\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\njQuery: http://jquery.com/ -- tested with v1.8.2.\r\n\r\nA browser that supports canvas. Tested in Firefox 16 and Internet Explorer 9.\r\nIt doesn't do anything very fancy with canvas and so should work in other\r\nbrowsers.\r\n"}
